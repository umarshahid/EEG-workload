# EEG-workload
Regarding EEG based mental worklaod assessment using machine learning.

# Ms Thesis
This is the main folder of MS research work regarding EEG based mental workload assessment on benchmark STEW dataset.
In this folder there are some folders regarding work and prodessed data.
# Folders
## eeglab2019_1 
EEGLAB toolbox for EEG data processing.
## STEW dataset
This is benchmark dataset we have used in our implementation and downloaded from IEEE Dataport.
## Overall_processed_data 
This is processed data for 
- 10 values of ASR
- All 4 window sizes
- All 4 overlap sizes
## Combined_Region
This is the processed data set for 
- frontal + parietal regions
- frontal + Occipital regions
- frontal + parietal + occipital regions
## Individula_Region
This is processed datased of individual region
- frontal 
- parietal 
- occipital
## Indivdula_Channel
This is processed dataset of all individual 14-Channels.
## Frequency_Bands
This is processed dataset of individual and combined frequency bands
- Delta
- Theta
- Alpha
- Beta
- Gamma
- Frontal Alpha + Parietal Theta
- Frontal Alpha + Occipital Theta
- Frontal & Parietal Alpha + Theta
- Frontal & Occipital Alpha + Theta
## Time_Effect
This is effect of window and overlap size on time in which we have used 
- 4 window sizes
- 9 Overlap sizes
for all 10 ASR threshold values.
## x initial rough experiments
In this folder there are differnt rough experiments with randon values of ASR, random window and overlap sizes.
